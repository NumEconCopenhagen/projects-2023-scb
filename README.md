This repository contains  
1. Inaugural project. 
2. Data project. We fetch data from **Yahoo Finance** and **www.ugenr.dk** on Swedish and Indian stock indices and dates of Easter, respectively. We analyze the effects from Easter on stock returns, but do not conclude anything. 
3. Model project. We model the **Solow Model with Human Capital**. We simulate the model and compare the simulation with the analytical solution. We use SciPy's 'Nelder-Mead' function to optimize the savings rates numerically.
