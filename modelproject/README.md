# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **The Solow Model with Human Capital** and is about the analytical solution as well as simulation of the Solow Model with human capital. We examine scenarios with different initial values as well as the long-term effect on steady state values following a shock to the savings rate of human capital.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
