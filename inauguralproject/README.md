# Inaugural project

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).
Some of the results from the code are stored in the files results_sigma_low.pkl and resultsbigloop.pkl.
The two pickle files are used in inauguralproject.ipynb

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project should not require further packages.
